# Test Agent - No Skill Shim

This is a test fixture for an agent that does not use the skill shim.

## Behavior

This agent reviews code and provides feedback.
It does not invoke any skill-layer tools.

1. Read the implementation files
2. Compare against requirements
3. Provide critique with severity ratings

## Notes

This agent is compliant because:
1. It does NOT use the skill shim script
2. Therefore no skill documentation heading is required
