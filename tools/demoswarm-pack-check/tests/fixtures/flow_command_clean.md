# Flow Test - Clean

This is a test fixture representing a flow command file with no violations.

## Purpose

This flow processes requirements and delegates to agents appropriately.

## Instructions

1. Call the requirements-author agent to draft requirements
2. Call the clarifier agent for open questions
3. Proceed to the next station when complete

## Notes

- All agent delegation uses proper phrasing
- No direct skill invocations
- Flows should not use skill layer directly
