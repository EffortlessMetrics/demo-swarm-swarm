- `build/self_review.md`

## Next Steps

Build cleanup encountered an environmental failure:

**Issue:** The build directory `.runs/local-alignment-audit-aba1c6/build/` is inaccessible due to I/O permission restrictions. The cleanup agent cannot:
- List or verify artifact files
- Extract quality gate statuses
- Derive mechanical counts

**Upstream Status:** All build stations reported completion (run-prep, repo-operator, context-loader, clarifier, AC loop [32 ACs + 3 NFRs], doc-writer/critic, lint-executor, test-executor, flakiness-detector, mutation-auditor, fuzz-triager, self-reviewer). The upstream work appears complete; this is an environmental issue.

**Action Required:**
1. Verify file system permissions on `.runs/local-alignment-audit-aba1c6/build/`
2. Check that the directory is not locked by another process
3. Ensure the build directory has read/write access for the agent environment
4. Rerun `/flow-3-build` build-cleanup after permissions are corrected
