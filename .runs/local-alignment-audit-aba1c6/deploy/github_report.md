## Deployment Log

- PR merged: yes (#2)
- Commit SHA: ed9b9c98b7a353a29671d489148fef3ba08d933e
- Branch: main (source: run/local-alignment-audit-aba1c6, now deleted)
- Merged by: EffortlessSteven
- Tag: v1.0.0-local-alignment-audit-aba1c6 (annotated, pushed)

## Key Artifacts

- `deploy/deployment_decision.md` — verdict: NOT_DEPLOYED (governance constraint: branch protection not enabled)
- `deploy/deployment_log.md` — merge completed, tag pushed
- `deploy/verification_report.md` — smoke_signal: STABLE; all post-merge checks passed
- `deploy/flow_plan.md` — deploy flow execution record

## Governance Context

Branch protection is not enabled on main branch. The GitHub API returned 404 "Branch not protected," meaning required status checks are not enforced. This is an **org-level / repo-settings constraint**, not a defect in the run artifacts.

The merge operation **succeeded completely**:

- PR #2 merged via merge commit (preserves full audit trail)
- Release tag created and pushed
- All flow command files verified present and correct
- No "six flows" documentation drift remaining
- Pack structure and contracts intact

## Next Steps

- ✅ Deploy operation completed. Merge is on main, tag is pushed.
- ⚠️ NOT_DEPLOYED verdict due to governance constraint (branch protection). Recommended action: **Enable branch protection on main branch** via GitHub repo settings to enforce required status checks.
- ➜ Proceed to Flow 7 (Wisdom) to harvest learnings and close feedback loops.
- 👀 Monitor main branch for Pack CI execution (expected to trigger within GitHub Actions SLA).
