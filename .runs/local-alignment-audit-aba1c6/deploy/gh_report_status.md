## Content Posted
Flow 6 (Deploy) completion report with deployment summary, merge details (PR #2 → main at ed9b9c98), tag creation (v1.0.0-local-alignment-audit-aba1c6), smoke signal (STABLE), and governance context (branch protection not configured). Deploy verdict: NOT_DEPLOYED due to org-level constraint. Recommended next steps: enable branch protection + proceed to Flow 7 (Wisdom).
