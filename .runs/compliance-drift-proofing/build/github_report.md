- `build/test_execution.md` (canonical test results, VERIFIED)
- `build/self_review.md` (self-reviewer verdict: VERIFIED)

## Prior Bounce Resolution

Gate previously BOUNCED due to discrepancy between build_receipt.json and test_execution.md:

- **Issue:** Receipt claimed 420 tests/89.29% coverage but test_execution.md showed only 294 tests/75.12% coverage (aspirational vs canonical)
- **Root Cause:** Receipt sealed without canonical test artifact refresh
- **Resolution:** Test-executor re-ran full suite, updated test_execution.md with verified counts, all quality gates confirmed VERIFIED
- **Status:** All blockers cleared; receipt now reflects authoritative data from artifacts

## Next Steps

✅ Build complete and VERIFIED. Ready for Flow 4 (Gate) processing.

**Flow 4 Recommendation:** Proceed to gate-orchestrator for final merge decision. All prior blockers resolved; artifact integrity confirmed; all quality gates VERIFIED.
