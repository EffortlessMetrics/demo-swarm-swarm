## 2024-05-23 - Improving AI-Generated Markdown UX
**Learning:** When improving the UX of AI-generated content (like PR descriptions), we are effectively "prompt engineering" for UX. The "code" is the prompt template.
**Action:** Use clear examples *and* explicit design principles in the prompt. For navigation, ensure anchor links in the example match the section headers in the example, and add a meta-instruction to maintain this link integrity. Adding "Quick Navigation" and status icons significantly improves the scanability of text-heavy AI reports.
