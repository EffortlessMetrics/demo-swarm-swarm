# Intent to Narrative

> The pipeline that transforms ideas into trusted changes.

## The Flow of Meaning

The system is not "kernel truth at the top" as a philosophy. **Intent is the starting point.** The pipeline flows from intent to narrative:

```
Intent → Candidates → Evidence → Decision → Narrative
```

### 1. Intent

What we are trying to build:
- Problem statements
- Requirements (REQ/NFR markers)
- BDD scenarios
- ADRs and design decisions
- Contracts and schemas

Intent is authored by humans (with machine assistance). It defines success criteria.

### 2. Candidates

What the swarm produces:
- Implementation code
- Tests
- Documentation
- Migrations

Candidates are generated by agents. They are provisional until verified.

### 3. Evidence

Proof that candidates meet intent:
- Test results (exit codes, pass/fail counts)
- Critic findings (issues by severity)
- Mutation scores (test effectiveness)
- Coverage metrics
- Security scans

Evidence is produced by tools and agents. It is grounded in mechanical truth.

### 4. Decision

The verdict:
- Merge or bounce
- Ready for human review or needs more work
- Ship or fix

Decisions are made by orchestrators based on evidence, not vibes.

### 5. Narrative

The human-facing summary:
- PR cockpit (hotspots, quality events, proof pointers)
- Receipts (what happened, what was verified)
- Recommendations (what to review, what to trust)

Narrative compresses the evidence into reviewable form.

## Where Kernel Truth Fits

Kernel truth (repo state, diffs, exit codes) is not the "goal."

It is the **sensor substrate** that makes evidence reliable:
1. **Kernel:** OS, filesystem, tool exit codes (cannot be argued with)
2. **Derived:** Counts and metrics from deterministic tools
3. **Intent:** BDD scenarios, ADRs, contracts (what we meant to build)
4. **Binary:** Implementation code (what we actually built)
5. **Narrative:** Agent chat, status updates (useful for debugging, not for truth)

When sources conflict, trust flows down this hierarchy. An agent's claim does not override an exit code.

## The Review Posture

Humans review:
- **Intent** — Is it wise? Does it solve the right problem?
- **Evidence** — Did we prove it? Are the tests meaningful?
- **Narrative** — Is it coherent? Are the claims supported?

Code is inspectable when needed, but it is not the primary review surface.

The goal: a 2000-line PR that is fully tested, mutation-verified, and critic-approved—reviewable in 30 minutes—is better than twenty 100-line PRs requiring 15 minutes each.

## The Compression Imperative

A 70,000-line change becomes:
- 5-bullet summary
- 10-row evidence table
- 3 hotspot pointers
- 1 ship/no-ship recommendation

That's 30 seconds to scan, not 40 hours to read.

Every unnecessary line in the narrative increases DevLT. Compress ruthlessly.
