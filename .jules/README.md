# .Jules

This folder contains notes and findings from [Jules](https://jules.google.com) automated improvement tasks.

## Structure

- `findings/` - Learnings and observations from improvement tasks

## Purpose

Jules periodically analyzes this repository and proposes improvements. This folder captures the reasoning and learnings from those tasks, separate from the implementation changes themselves.

These notes help future maintainers (human or machine) understand:
- What patterns were identified
- What improvements were considered
- Why certain approaches were chosen
