# Example Artifacts

These are synthetic but realistic examples of swarm-generated artifacts. They demonstrate the expected format and content, not actual outputs.

| Example | Shows |
|---------|-------|
| `pr-cockpit.md` | PR description format (the primary review UI) |
| `code-critique.md` | Critique with CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR/SUGGESTION |
| `build-receipt.md` | Durable record of what Build flow produced |
| `open-questions.md` | How uncertainty is tracked (DEFAULTED vs NEEDS_HUMAN) |

These examples are intentionally small and focused. Real artifacts may be longer but follow the same structure.
